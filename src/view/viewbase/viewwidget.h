/**
@brief Base class for a views "display" component.

A view widget bases on a QWidget and provides a way to display
the views data, which is held in a model.

A view widget may hold an event processor, which is used to react in a specific
way to mouse and keyboard events. A new ViewWidget will most likely introduce a new
event processor.

Sometimes a ViewWidget is composed of more ViewWidgets, f.e. to be able to set a different
event processor for each part.
