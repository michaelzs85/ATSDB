@brief Stores cross view selection entries and propagates them to the views.

This singleton class is used for cross selection between several views.
The entries represent items in the database which may be visualized differently
in each view. Only visual items which relate to unique database items may be
used for cross selection.

The selection process works as follows.
- A ViewWidget generates a new selection (e.g. scene queries in OgreViewWidget).
- It clears the selection, which sends an unselect event to all views.
- The view models use the old selection to unselect the currently selected items.
- A ViewModel may change/convert/cancel the new selection and then send it to the selection (or not).
- The selection sends a select event to all views.
- The view models use the new selection entries to select the items.

@todo A ViewSelectionEntry can be used to store a display object, which actually makes only sense
for a view specific selection.
