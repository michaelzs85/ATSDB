/**
@brief Serves as base class for all views. Subclasses can be embedded in a ViewContainerWidget.

A view consists of two main components, a widget to display its content (not specifically a qt widget)
and a model manage its data. To add a new view to palantir, one will typically have to introduce three
new classes: a view class, a view widget class and a view model class. These classes should be named
similarly, e.g. *View, *ViewModel, *ViewWidget. Often these classes have to be derived from a similar
group of coherent classes. For example a new view based on a DBView will need a model based on a
DBViewModel and a widget based on a DBViewWidget.

A view always has a center widget, in which the ViewWidget is embedded. The central widget will then again
always be embedded inside a ViewContainerWidget, which shows the specific views in tabs.
