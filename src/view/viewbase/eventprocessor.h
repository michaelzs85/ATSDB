/**
@brief Base class for all event processors.

An event processor provides a way to handle keyboard and mouse events individually in a
ViewWidget. For this derive from this class and reimplement the provided event handling methods.

The methods return if they have handled the event. When reimplementing them in a derived
class, one should first call the base class versions and check if these methods handled the event.
If not they may handle the event themselves and should return if they did so afterwards.
